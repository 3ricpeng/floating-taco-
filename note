# Origin

As an L1 Analyst, there are tasks that I find repetitive, that's why I started to investigate in ways to automate the process to improve the L1 work​


# Issue

## Overview of L1 Workflow

- Call Start (tools used: ServiceNow Landing Page)
- General troubleshooting (tools used: Jarvis/SNOW/EloView/Esper/Retool/Putty etc)
- Info Gathering (tools used: ServiceNow KB Page) 
- Escalation (tools used: ServiceNow Incident Page / Teams Post)
- Call Ends (tools used: ServiceNow Incident Page)


## Frictions Identify
- Jumping back and force between different tools to collect information 
- Small hurdles

# Technical Details 
## Code Structure 
## Next Steps 
1. Flush Out CR Template Logic                   +++
2. Add Testing for Chrome & Edge                 +++
